I\u2019ll explain by example. Imagine the situation: You are using an ad blocker/messenger app. You\u2019re using it because it was most popular/everyone is using it. You think it\u2019s really good, you could even pay for it. One day you see ads on popular websites/news that the company listens to everything you say through your messenger app. You can think: \u201cwow, that\u2019s bad. I need to do something with it\u201d - And then\u2026 You just don\u2019t. There are no websites with ads other day/company that owns mess app publicly apologizes and assures that this will not happen again. Everything resolved "by itself". You forget about it till the next time something happens. And it certainly will. These are bad products. An inappropriate behaviour here is betrayal of the idea for profit/invasion of privacy. And you not only are not fighting this treatment but letting it continue. Usually if someone asks you for advice about an ad blocker/a mess app, you could name this bad one. So you\u2019re making bad products spread and letting everyone know that you are good with such an attitude towards you. So they build more apps like this. Sorry, but you\u2019re making the internet worse!</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__subtitle">Part II</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">So\u2026 What can you do? Almost any(read: any) product has good analogs. You can find it if you spend a few more minutes before installing. But your friends are not going to be there(if we talk about messenger, for example), aren\u2019t they? Changing the world isn\u2019t our goal - changing ourselves is. That\u2019s the only one way it is. If one does want to chat with you, one is going to find a way to do it. You will be surprised how much you can change outside yourself once you do it inside. Explain your position to your friends. Tell them you want to use good software and not bad one and why. Why would you want it?</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__subtitle">Part III</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">As I wrote above, by not fighting inappropriate behaviour you let it continue. Let it spread. Let the internet deteriorate. Let the author of this treatment see that you are ok with it, that he can continue treating you like this. So, once he can gain profit from this, he will. It\u2019s sort of a vicious circle. You can\u2019t sit, do nothing and expect the world to be better. What if\u2026 You uninstall a bad application, find its good alternative and start to use it? Let\u2019s see:\n\t\t\tYou improve the quality of your life. Obviously.\n\t\t\tYou let the app owner know that you\u2019re refusing to use it anymore. No big deal, is it?\n\t\t\tYou stop spreading this soft towards your surroundings. It seems like a big deal to me.\n\t\t\tIf everyone had behaved themself like this, there wouldn\u2019t have been bad products across the world. Since we\u2019re talking about software, there is a list of some nice and not nice treatment you could have missed:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__subtitle">Part IV</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">There are only facts, confirmed(and apologized) by companies:\n\t\t\tApple is eavesdropping.\n\t\t\tFacebook is eavesdropping.\n\t\t\tFacebook is reading your messages.\n\t\t\tApple is cooperating with the FBI.\n\t\t\tApple is slowing down their phones.\n\t\t\tSamsung is slowing down their phones.\n\t\t\tFacebook services are leaking personal data. Link1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\t\t\tVK is cooperating with the government.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">You can read a nice article, why any of Facebook products is dangerous to use - written by the creator of Telegram. Also, there are always rumors that Google or Facebook listens to what you say and then shows ads about it. But there are no facts. We can\u2019t rely on this.\n\t\t\tHow do you find good software? Usually, there are only a few common points:\n\t\t\tOpen source.\n\t\t\tNon-commercial.\n\t\t\tIf a product can be described as one of those, it might be a good one. If both of above, it certainly is.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">Open source means everyone can see the code. So if there are some issues, people will find it out. People can improve it. For example, the most safe messenger app is Telegram. It is open source and there were no major data leaks in its history, because a lot of people collaborated and improved it. On the other hand, almost any other messenger app was hacked, or leaked some amount of personal data: Whatsap-link, viber-link, skypel-ink.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">And non-commercial means, that to gain profit from application is not the goal. So the creator is not interested in betraying his idea for money or something else. I create non-commercial applications. PopUpOFF is a good example. It provides unique functionality and is absolutely free.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">Here is a list of all open source software, you might find something good - link.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__subtitle">Part V</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">Finally, what my mission is. As a  human - I want to live in a better world. And by \u201cwant\u201d I don\u2019t mean \u201cI would like you to improve it\u201d, but to do it by myself and motivate as many people as I can, hopefully, you:)</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p class="post__text">When we talk about the internet, I\u2019m much more powerful than the average user here due to my profession. So I\u2019m trying to apply my knowledge to make someone\u2019s life better by my products- link, and to make someone notice, by this article.

				From the technical side, I do really like <span class="offer__word">JavaScript</span>. There are a lot of good frameworks I am good with, like <span class="offer__word">Angular or React</span>, but I like plain JS most. I had a lot of projects with <span class="offer__word">WebGL and Three.js - browser, mobile and desktop apps, games</span>. My <span class="offer__word">CSS3 and HTML5</span> are strong. I still care about <span class="offer__word">semantics, cross-browser compatibility and accessibility</span> - you can always check it in <a href="https://github.com/Romanisthere" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">my Git</a>.

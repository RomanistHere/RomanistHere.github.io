			<p class="article__text">I won't be trying to answer "the question" through this writing but rather will be trying to explain why it's not as interesting as it seems to be. You may accidentally find the answer though. <s>42.</s></p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Disclaimer: You can either agree with my opinion or not. But you can hardly tell me that it does not make sense.</strong></p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Religion was never about Him but about you.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Let's start with another question: what are the points of different religions anyway? If we were to compare religions like Buddhism,  Christianity, Islam, Hinduism - we would find that they "offer" similiar things. <strong class="article__col-4">Some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual)"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">"Enlightenment"</a> and some kind of a path you need to pass to make it there. Usually, it's not only the pass, but someone who made it to the top back there.</strong></p>

			<p class="article__text">So we have guidelines backed by "the real" experience. But are these paths that different? To answer this question we need to understand what spiritual development means.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">What spiritual development is not.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">And I'll make my definition based on what it isn't. There are different sorts of developments for self. There are skills one can learn: how to make more money, sleep better, run faster and so on. The reason for them to be in the same group is that they are material-mental-sphere - <strong class="article__col-4">they depend on time.</strong></p>

			<p class="article__text">Spirit does not.</p>

			<p class="article__text">In simple words, the goal of spiritual growth is <strong class="article__col-4">to achieve eternity. Prepare our souls to live forever</strong>. And this sounds exactly like something religions exist for. They differ in how to define "forever", or what one can eat and what can't, or how to name the major events. But they fail to be very different when it comes to the end of the path of one's spiritual growth.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3">So what spiritual development is.</h3>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Asceticism, mainly</strong>. Our brain is different from our mind, our consciousness. And evolution made it possible for our brain to ignore our mind.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Need an example? Imagine when you're getting ready to study some things you need to become more successful. They are not the most interesting things. Your consciousness understands that it's something important if you want to be successful. Your lazy brain, on the other hand, tries to make you postpone this process, ideally to "never". It tries to distract you with images of your success after you have learnt whatever it is you're doing.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Thing is, not a lot of us are in control of our brain</strong>. While we're not, we're apes, spiritually. <s>un</s>Lucky, our brain hides the thoughts about us not being able to control our life behind the illusion that we can.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Destroying this illusion and gaining more control over our own thoughts and emotions</strong> in the pursuit of becoming a better person is what spiritual development is.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part4">Is it possible?</h3>

			<p class="article__text">There are countless practices on taking ownership over our brain. Religions are among them. But there is a huge difference between religion and practices like yoga or meditation. Well, it won't come as "huge" on the paper (screen), but in reality it takes into account our human nature and the generations of people’s experience.</p>

			<p class="article__text">We're totally able to grow our spirit without the help of any religion. But it takes a great deal of work. <strong class="article__col-4">Fighting your own brain is one of the hardest things to do</strong>. And communities and traditions are strong allies in it.</p>

			<p class="article__text">It's important to notice that <strong class="article__col-4">the reason is what makes this growth spiritual</strong>. If one wants power over his brain to become wealthy, this growth becomes material oriented. It becomes what we call self development. The reasons matter.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part5">How does it work?</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Different practices (in- and out-religious) like fasting, meditations,  sexual abstinence, mantras and koans have the same simple thing in common: taking control over the voice in your head. The voice constanly wants something: to eat, drink, imagine things, have sex. <strong class="article__col-4">Saying "no" to it will gain you control over time</strong>. The more "no"s you say, the better it behaves.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Generally if you are able to <strong class="article__col-4">just sit and not think for 40 minutes in a row, you won't need any religion or other practices to make it to the top</strong>. Why don't you try? :)</p>

			<p class="article__text">Hard, is it? That's why people go to religions. It's a trick. Hard to not think when there is no reason to. Easier if <strong class="article__col-4">your brain is scared of or inspired by God</strong> or other members of the community.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part6">Does God exist?</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Might be, might be not. The thing is, it doesn't really matter. Religion is about you and not Him.</p>

			<p class="article__text">The answer to this question is just as trivial as the ending of Anna Karenina or Martin Eden. There is nothing we can do about it. But there are questions indeed we're able to do something about. Care to ask them?</p>

		imageLink: `https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/tree/chore/migrate-to-svelte`,
		content: `
			<p class="article__text">Hi! I recently learnt Svelte and fell in love with it. So much, that I decided to move my service, Measureland, to SvelteKit. Today I want to share how I solved one of the challenges that I faced: managing overlays in the app.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">How it was before.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">There are about ten different modals or popups and a few states of sidebar plus ways to combine them. App was originally written in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so it was as simple as calling <strong class="article__col-3">openPopup(popupClassName)</strong> on click. <strong class="article__col-3">openPopup</strong> function searched for the given class in DOM and added <strong class="article__col-3">"active"</strong> class to it. Simple imperative implementation. I had almost 2k strings in my <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/blob/legacy/index.html"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">index.html file</a> with all these popups there.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">What we need now (challenge).</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Svelte is declarative and component based. It means we can have a single popup component for all popups. It helps us to not repeat ourselves, but searching the DOM is not an option anymore. As well as adding a class to make modals visible. We need to do it in a declarative way. Means we need our app to know about every popup there is, so we can tell it: "hey, open this popup" - and it will. The biggest problem is that we can't call the popup1-component method from popup2-component directly. And especially if we need to call it from another component tree. (We technically can, but it's very complex to do and support).</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3 changes">How we do it.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Let's start by telling our app all about the popups. I created a file: <strong class="article__col-3">overlayStateDefault.js</strong> - under constants in the lib folder (<a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/blob/chore/migrate-to-svelte/src/lib/constants/overlayStateDefault.js"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">full version</a>):</p>

			<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">
export const overlayStateDefault = {
	loginPopup: {
		isOpen: false,
		type: 'popup',
		data: {},
	},
	registerPopup: {
		isOpen: false,
		type: 'popup',
		data: {},
	},
	...
};
			</code></pre>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-3">isOpen</strong>: tells our app when we it open
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-3">type</strong>: tells our app what type of overlay we want to open (and close other overlays with this type)
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-3">data</strong>: we will most definitely want to pass data to some of the popups (instead of using global state)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="article__text">Let's create superb Svelte store to make use of it (<a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/blob/chore/migrate-to-svelte/src/stores/state.js#L44"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">full version</a>):</p>

			<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">
export const overlayStateStore = writable(overlayStateDefault);
			</code></pre>


			<p class="article__text">Good. Next step is to write a few functions to work with it in a declarative way. I have <strong class="article__col-3">helpers.js</strong> file in <strong class="article__col-3">lib/utilities</strong>, let see our functions (<a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/blob/chore/migrate-to-svelte/src/lib/utilities/helpers.js#L93"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">full version</a>):</p>

			<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">
const closeOverlaysWithSameType = (overlayType, state) => {
    let isModalOpen = false;

    const keysArray = Object.keys(state);
    const length = keysArray.length;

	keysArray.forEach((item, i) => {
		const { type, isOpen } = state[keysArray[i]];
        if (overlayType === type && isOpen) {
            // mutation here should be faster and has no consequences
            state[keysArray[i]].isOpen = false;
        } else {
            // check if any of other modals are open
            if (isOpen)
                isModalOpen = true;

    return {
        newState: state,
        isModalOpen,
    };
}

const openAnotherOverlay = (overlayName = null, data = {}) => {
    try {
		overlayStateStore.update(state => {
	        const overlayType = state[overlayName]['type'];
	        const { newState } = closeOverlaysWithSameType(overlayType, state);
	        return ({ ...newState, [overlayName]: { ...newState[overlayName], isOpen: true, data } });
	    });
	} catch (e) {
		console.warn('Define popup in constatns/overlayStateDefault.js');
	}
}

const closeOverlay = (overlayType = null) => {
    if (overlayType) {
        overlayStateStore.update(state => {

            if (!isModalOpen)
                appStateStore.update(state => ({ ...state, openModal: false }));

            return ({ ...newState });
        });
    } else {
        overlayStateStore.update(state => overlayStateDefault);
        appStateStore.update(state => ({ ...state, openModal: false }));
    }
}

const closeOverlays = () => closeOverlay();
			</code></pre>

			<p class="article__text">A lot of code, but nothing scary. <strong class="article__col-3">closeOverlaysWithSameType</strong> is a helper-helper function. We call it to close currently opened popup-type modals before we open a new one.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-3">openAnotherOverlay</strong> changes <strong class="article__col-3">isOpen</strong> property of the needed modal. <strong class="article__col-3">closeOverlay</strong> changes all the <strong class="article__col-3">isOpen</strong> properties for the needed type to <strong class="article__col-3">false</strong>. <strong class="article__col-3">closeOverlays</strong> reuses our <strong class="article__col-3">overlayStateDefault</strong> object to return overlays to the default state (close all modals) saving some time and calculations.</p>

			<p class="article__text">We have everything ready, now, how to use it in the app? Reasonable question, let's go!</p>

			<p class="article__text">I have an <strong class="article__col-3">Overlay.svelte</strong> component used in <strong class="article__col-3">routes/index.svelte</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/blob/chore/migrate-to-svelte/src/lib/components/Overlay/Overlay.svelte"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">full version</a>). This component has a few key points:</p>

			<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">
const checkIsOpen = state => {
	let openOverlays = [];
	for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(state)) {
		const { isOpen, data, type } = value;
		if (isOpen)
			openOverlays.push({ key, data, type });
	}

	if (openOverlays.length >= 2 && openOverlays[0].type === openOverlays[1].type) {
		throw new Error("Can't open two or more modals at once");
	}

	if (openOverlays.length === 1 && openOverlays[0].key === 'commentsSidebar') {
		// close sidebar if only comments is opened (expected behaviour: user closes rating)
		openOverlays = [];
		closeOverlays();
	}

	return openOverlays;
}

const manageOverlay = ({ key, data, type }) => {
	if (type === 'sidebar') {
		sidebarName = key;
		sidebarData = data;
		sidebarActive = true;
		if (browser)
			document.body.classList.add('sidebar-open');
	} else if (type === 'popup') {
		popupName = key;
		popupData = data;
		popupActive = true;
	}
}

const manageOverlays = openOverlays => {
	// TODO: change document.body.classList when resolved:
	// https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/3105#issuecomment-622437031
	if (browser)
		document.body.classList.remove('sidebar-open');

	sidebarActive = false;
	popupActive = false;

	if (openOverlays.length === 0)
		return;

	openOverlays.forEach(manageOverlay);
}

$: dataOpen = checkIsOpen($overlayStateStore);
$: manageOverlays(dataOpen);
			</code></pre>

			<p class="article__text">The last two strings are responsible for tracking all the changes in <strong class="article__col-3">overlayStateStore</strong> (thanks to reactivity) and passing the data to needed components. For example, if some of popup-type instances is opened, <strong class="article__col-3">manageOverlays</strong> function will get its name (key) and data and pass it to <strong class="article__col-3">PopupLayer</strong> component (<a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/blob/chore/migrate-to-svelte/src/lib/components/Overlay/components/popups/PopupLayer.svelte"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">full version</a>):</p>


			<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">
{#if popupActive}
    &lt;PopupLayer { popupName } { popupData } /&gt;
{/if}
			</code></pre>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-3">PopupLayer</strong>, on the other hand, has a dictionary with pairs: <strong class="article__col-3">popupName - component</strong> and <strong class="article__col-3">svelte:component</strong> construction, to load modals dynamically based on <strong class="article__col-3">popupName</strong> passed from parent component:</p>

			<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">
&lt;script&gt
	...
	const popupList = {
		loginPopup: LoginPopup,
		registerPopup: RegisterPopup,
		...
	};
	...
	$: Popup = popupList[popupName]['component'];
	...
&lt;/script&gt
&lt;div class="rating" on:click|preventDefault={closePopups}&gt
    &lt;svelte:component this={Popup} { popupData }/&gt
&lt;/div&gt
			</code></pre>

			<p class="article__text">That's it. The post is already too long, so let's summarize:</p>

			<p class="article__text">Now we can open our login popup from any part of an app by calling <strong class="article__col-3">openAnotherOverlay('loginPopup')</strong> - everything else is on the side of reactivity, our helper functions and a few components. You can find the full code in <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/tree/chore/migrate-to-svelte"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">my repo</a> (migration is not finished yet).</p>

			<p class="article__text">Feel free to contact me (<a href="mailto:romanisthere@pm.me" class="link">RomanistHere@pm.me</a>) about any questions, suggestions or improvements. We can also move all the structure to a separate module and publish it.

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1 firefox">Firefox is slowing down.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">It's the most annoying thing I have faced while developing. Version for Mozilla is in sort of the beta-stage right now. <strong class="article__col-4">Firefox itself has a bug related to how PopUpOFF works, so sometimes it could freeze the loading of the page for a few seconds</strong>. So I'd suggest using PopUpOFF in this browser only for very nasty websites, where you have really no other choice. I'm going to find a way to fix it in the next update, so don't worry, everything should be good soon! Personally I'd recommend to switch to <a href="../two-tools" class="link">another browser</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2 whitelist">How to whitelist a website?</h3>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Dormant mode</strong>. Most recommended option (and the way I use it) is <strong class="article__col-4">to set Dormant mode as your Automode</strong> in the <a class="link optPage" href="#">options page</a>. This way when you enter a new website it will look as usual. And if you wanted to remove all the popups from the screen, you could activate the needed mode. PopUpOFF will remember the website and the next time you visit it, popups are going to be blocked automatically.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3 changes">Changes don't apply.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Software can't be bugless, at least in the current state. Sometimes one can't be even sure that it's the one's bug. So what to do if you're facing it? The simplest solution would be <a href="https://romanisthere.github.io/PopUpOFF-Website/index.html"  target="_blank" class="link">to reinstall</a> the extension. I also added the buttons to reset settings in the <a class="link optPage" href="#">options page</a> - it could help. However, if you wanted PopUpOFF to be better, the best solution would be <strong class="article__col-4">to try to understand what is not working, how it's happening and drop me a message</strong>: <a href="mailto:romanisthere@pm.me" class="link">RomanistHere@pm.me</a> - I'd be more than happy to assist you.</p>

Parasites increase their own fitness by exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, in particular by feeding on them and by using intermediate (secondary) hosts to assist in their transmission from one definitive (primary) host to another...</q> - One more thing to keep in mind is that <strong class="article__col-4">parasites need their host</strong>. Most terrible event that can happen is to lose it, so they are not interested in killing or losing "master". Instead most <a href="https://factrepublic.com/facts/16527/"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">advanced-designed</a> parasites make sure <strong class="article__col-4">its master is happy, healthy so it can carry pests to the spread</strong> and grow.</p>

			<p class="article__text">You should be getting my point now. If you pause and think for a little, you’re going to easily find that it’s not so ridiculous as it seems at the first sight. From this point <strong class="article__col-4">all this “Digital wellness” is just a hypocrisy, a trick to make us (hosts) more happy, so we can carry and spread the system further</strong>.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3">Quote explanation (skip if you got it).</h3>

			<p class="article__text"><q class="article__col-3">...the parasite, lives on or inside another organism, the host, causing it some harm...</q> - Uses someone for a living, causing some harm. I provided 11 links about the "harm" part <a href="#start" class="link">above</a>. There are different ways, check it out. <q class="article__col-3">...and is adapted structurally to this way of life...</q> - Isn't it a dream? Technology that <a href="https://www.ukrealty.in/blog/2019/09/10/a-home-that-adapts-to-you-smart-home-tech-is-already-here/"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">adapts</a> to you?</p>

			<p class="article__text"><q class="article__col-3">...Parasites reduce host fitness by general or specialised pathology, from parasitic castration to modification of host behaviour...</q> - do you care about your comments online? The way you look in those photos? How much likes are you going to get? What was that notification on your phone a few minutes ago? Doesn't it sound like changes in your original behaviour?</p>

			- You can say, that term castration does not fit here. And on the physiological level it mostly doesn't, but I'm more interested in the philosophical and psychological ones. When we think about what we would like to do more, watch Netflix, play WoW or go meet someone, whoever we are, there are always chances that our brain would go for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMq_MyOFtW8"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">easiest dopamine shot</a>. It's one of the ways I see digital castration could work. It sounds ridiculous, but has every reason to exist.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part4">Final words.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">I don’t claim that I’m right, but it should be an interesting thing to think about. I encourage you! Here and right now <strong class="article__col-4">we have the opportunity to observe how the system evolves</strong>.</p>

			<p class="article__text">It’s important to understand that there is no man beyond that. Probably back in days… but now it’s the system. <strong class="article__col-4">It’s evolving, it's growing, it's conquering.</strong> Truly digital parasitism!</p>

			<p class="article__text">It’s not critical, we can live with parasites. In fact a lot of us do even with more obvious ones

			<p class="article__text">PopUpOFF has the “Anti-paid” feature. It's created <strong class="article__col-4">to prevent paid content from hiding.</strong> In this article we are going to learn how to use it.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">How to make it right.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">There are websites (<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/09/03/americas-ugly-election"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">example</a>) that show you a full article, and after a few seconds - boom, it's reduced and the only thing you see is a note that you need to subscribe/login/donate in order to continue your reading. That's where PopUpOFF comes. Press the “Anti-paid” button, wait till the page load and voilà... Enjoy your free story.</p>


			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">I still can't see the full content of the article.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">PopUpOFF isn’t working properly if:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					After (or during) the page is downloaded <strong class="article__col-4">you can see the full article</strong> and after some time pass, it’s <strong class="article__col-4">reduced</strong>.

					You see popups and overlays everywhere.

			<p class="article__text">If you can’t see the full article <strong class="article__col-4">during the loading of the page - there is nothing I can do</strong>. PopUpOFF can prevent content from reducing. But if there was no content from the start, it has nothing to work with.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Sorry, but we are not hacking anyone.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Thank you for attention and have a great life now. See ya!</p>

			<p class="article__text">There is a room for personalization and optimization in PopUpOFF - get advantage of it.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">The popup.</h3>

			<div class="article__img_wr article__img_wr-header">
	            <img
	                src="../../../assets/inline/newpopup.jpg"
	                class="article__img_small article__img_small-full_width"
					alt="Install events"
	                title="Install events"
	                loading="lazy">
	        </div>

			<p class="article__text">There are three modes: Aggressive, Moderate, Dormant. If we used previous versions of PopUpOFF, Dormant is our default now. Just installed - Moderate. So, let's see what are they:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Aggressive removes every stuck to our screen element</strong>. Not any overlay, popup or whatever it's called is going to distract us from reading. It's the reason this extension exists! Enjoy a clean screen:)
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					However, mostly <strong class="article__col-4">we need sticky headers and navigation bars</strong> to be displayed (some other popups too). That's where <strong class="article__col-4">Moderate</strong> comes. I worked very hard on this, so be gentle if something isn't working as you expect to. <a href="mailto:romanisthere@pm.me" class="link">Let me know</a> - I'll fix it:)
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Dormant</strong> does nothing. By clicking it, we are going to <a href="/posts/blacklist/" class="link">whitelist</a> the website. Default option for services like YouTube, Twitter, <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/PopUpOFF/blob/develop/constants/data.js#L15"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">etc</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="article__text">There are also <strong class="article__col-4">stats</strong> (at the top) and <strong class="article__col-4">"How to use"</strong> (at the bottom) links in the popup. Stats are fun, aren't they? We are going to learn how to disable it later. How-to-use-link leads us to the page we're at.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Anti-paid</strong> sometimes allows us to read paid content after it's reduced. <a href="/posts/prev-cont-2/" class="link">Does it work for every website?</a></p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2"><a class="link optPage" href="#">Options page.</a></h3>

			<p class="article__text">It is well-described by itself. Well, I'm going to share some thoughts with you anyway:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Automode</strong>. We can set Dormant as our automode and enable PopUpOFF manually (like in the old versions) on the needed websites. Or we can pick Moderate and change it to Aggressive or Dormant depending on the situation. If we really hated sticky elements we could pick Aggressive as our automode. We would have hard times searching in Google or YouTube though.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Statistics</strong>. It takes a little bit of performance and returns a lot of <a class="link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="/secrets/">fun</a>. If you feel like a 2-5% boost in performance will make a difference for you, disable it.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Keyboard shortcut</strong>. Drag (or click) to the mode you want fast access to. My setup, for example: automode - Moderate, shortcut - Aggressive. Now if we opened the page and there was a lot of scrolling content not removed by Moderate mode, we would press <strong class="article__col-4">Alt + x</strong> - and enjoy our ride. Aggressive mode activated.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Smart blocking</strong>. If you pick the "Strict" option - PopUpOFF will be leaving only headers and nav bars in Moderate mode. Default option should be fine for most websites in English, but if you want more, or read in other languages - "Strict" is probably your option.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="article__text">You can also manage our extension from <strong class="article__col-4">the context menu</strong> (right click) now.</p>

			<p class="article__text">That seems to be it. PopUpOFF 2.0 was recently released, so if something's wrong, don't worry, let me know, I will fix it.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Remember, it's a <strong class="article__col-4">non-commercial</strong> project. I'm not selling your stats or something. The only money supporting it - from you guys. <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.donationalerts.com/r/romanisthere">Donate</a> if you think your joy is worth it.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Thank you for attention and have a great life now. See ya!</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Prehistory</h3>

			<p class="article__text"><a href="https://romanisthere.github.io/PopUpOFF-Website/index.html"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Website I have this analytics on</a> is not the easiest target. Users get forwarded there right after the installation of PopUpOFF. And some guys (bots) are known to reinstall my extension programmatically. Let's see how our analytics will treat them.</p>

			<p class="article__text">There are 6 full days considered. I won't promise it's real data, but it's <s>plausible</s><strong class="article__col-4">accurate for our needs</strong>. And our needs are:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					to check the adequacy;
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					to compare accuracy;
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					to see how untrackable different browsers are;
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					to pick the best one;
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">Visits</h3>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Unique visitors</strong>. Different services detect "unique" in different ways. We can never know the real data, but GA looks like the weakest here, sorry Google.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Total pageviews</strong>. Let the fun begin. Plausible seemed good in unique visitors, but this one is "not plausible"(c). By the data we have we can say that Matomo and GA are very similar in this case. My logic tells me that they handle bots better.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Visit duration. Matomo and GA are ridiculous</strong>. Bounce rate was nonsense, so I just skipped it. <strong class="article__col-4">Plausible seems like the strong leader here</strong>. What's next?</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3">Installs</h3>

			<div class="article__img_wr article__img_wr-header">
	            <img
	                src="../../../assets/inline/analytic_browsers.jpg"
	                class="article__img_small article__img_small-full_width"

	                title="Install events"
	                loading="lazy">
	        </div>

			<p class="article__text">It's the data for all 6 days together. "From stores" is supposed to be equal to the total number of events. It's the number I get from Google store itself, for example. Edge doesn't provide any<s>thing</s> data. There are few interesting points:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					Plausible catched not a lot of unique Chrome installs. Unexpectedly bad.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					Firefox <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-is-blocked-by-firefox-mozilla-explains-why/311471/"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">blocks only GA</a>, <strong class="article__col-4">does it bad</strong>, though.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					Opera users are the <strong class="article__col-4">most uncatchable</strong> here. Good for them.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					Google store's stats look not accurate:(
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="article__text">Results are similar. Though Plausible has disappointed me a bit. Let's see the last category, shall we?</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part4">Page events</h3>

			<div class="article__img_wr article__img_wr-header">
	            <img
	                src="../../../assets/inline/analytic_events.jpg"
	                class="article__img_small article__img_small-full_width"

	                title="Page events"
	                loading="lazy">
	        </div>

			<p class="article__text">Results look the same. GA is, as expected, behind - any <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">privacy tool</a> <strong class="article__col-4">can block it</strong> nowadays. Plausible got a little bit more, assuming Matomo shows only total numbers, not unique.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part5">Conclusion</h3>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">Any tool will give you an average understanding</strong> of what's happening with your app or website. Most of the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2975193/9-steps-completely-anonymous-online.html"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">I-am-anonymous</a> guys are going to be uncaught by all the tracking services anyway. Plausible, as I see it, will give you more accurate data.</p>

			<p class="article__text">There is a second part coming. Technical, UX and UI comparison.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part6">P.S.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">I'm using <a href="https://brave.com/"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Brave</a> browser. <strong class="article__col-4">Haven't been tracked yet</strong>. Hello to all Firefox users:)</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Let's define word “black” as an example</h3>

			<p class="article__text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Wikipedia</a>: “black is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light.”</p>

			<p class="article__text"><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/black"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Dictionary.com</a>: “being a color that lacks hue and brightness and absorbs light without reflecting any of the rays composing it”</p>

			<p class="article__text"><a href="https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/are-black-and-white-colors"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Physics</a>: <strong class="article__col-4">black means no light</strong>. That’s why if we went in a larder and shut the door, all we would see is blackness.</p>

			<p class="article__text">White color is the opposite - it is all the colors, all the light.</p>

			<div class="article__img_wr article__img_wr-header">
	            <img
	                src="../../../assets/inline/universe.jpg"

	                loading="lazy">
	        </div>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Symbolism</h3>

			<p class="article__text">In terms of symbols <strong class="article__col-4">light (color) means life</strong>. And life points us to action. Black color means no actions then. It is exactly how our Universe works. So something in blacklist is supposed to have no action. And the whitelist is… I hope you got my idea.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Do you see any racism in physics and philosophy? What is it all about then?</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Symbols and signs</h3>

			<p class="article__text">The thing is that <strong class="article__col-4">we can put any value into any object or word</strong>. We can do it on a local level - like some family traditions - or as society. Let’s get back to our example.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">The moment we start to care whether we should use the word “black” or not - it is the moment we create racism</strong>. We add a new layer of meaning to the word that is to obscure everything it meant before. Literally displace it.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Philosophy</h3>


			<p class="article__text">If you don’t agree with the previous paragraph or don’t understand why, let me show you a little example. There is a thing like desecration. It could mean that some guy tells (or shows) a group of people that their sacred thing is not that sacred in the most disrespectful way. For example <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=desecrating+the+flag&newwindow=1&tbm=isch"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">burning the flag</a>. <strong class="article__col-4">By doing so, one accepts that it has value</strong>. No one will publicly and disrespectfully burn something valueless. So <strong class="article__col-4">an act of desecration is an act of both acceptance and sacralizing</strong>.</p>

			<div class="article__img_wr article__img_wr-header">
	            <img
	                src="../../../assets/inline/memorial.jpg"

	                loading="lazy">
	        </div>

			<p class="article__text">Almost exactly the same is going on with our topic example. <strong class="article__col-4">By not using the word “black” consciously we make racism exist. By telling that something is not racist we spawn and accept racism.</strong></p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">What is the problem?</h3>

			<p class="article__text">There are two, actually, as I see it. <strong class="article__col-4">Racism is just a symbol</strong> here. And we are constantly replacing meaning with symbols and signs.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Imagine the world, where everything we discuss, everything we do has sense. We are not afraid of using any words, moves, colors, e.t.c. Everything around us: mass media, people, art, objects - has its own meaning, value. They do not just point to something (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum#Philosophy"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">or to nothing at all</a>). Imagined? Our world is going in the exact opposite direction.</p>

			<p class="article__text">And secondly, does it not sound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak#Principles"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">a little bit familiar</a> to you? Don’t you think we will be better without the word “black”? Shouldn’t we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">add a new word</a>, “nolight”, for example, and use it to describe black color? George Orwell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">would approve</a>:)</p>

			<p class="article__text">It <a href="https://minimalism.life/journal/too-many-screens"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">is ridiculous</a> now to think that one day we won't be able to have a black cat or dog. But, as society, <strong class="article__col-4">we're doing our baby steps towards it</strong>.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Our privacy</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Google Analytics is a first thing that comes to mind when you think about tracking your app or webpage. It’s free, big, and it’s used ubiquitously. It comes with the Google quality. Where is the fallback?</p>

			<p class="article__text">Google is <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">the largest ad-tech company in the world</a>, so it constantly <a href="https://deletegoogle.com/#privacyForSale"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">sells our data</a>. While you could use it to understand how your users use the application, Google might use it differently. There is no way to know how, but <strong class="article__col-4">Google asks you to trust</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">We can only guess...</a></p>

			<p class="article__text">I could be trusting it with my data (I do not though). But not yours. So there will be no Google Analytics in my products again. Sorry Google.</p>

			<p class="article__text">There is also some amount of technical stuff to be considered:</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">It slows down the speed</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Because of "<strong class="article__col-4">more than 53% of all sites</strong> on the web track their visitors using Google Analytics", it's usually cached, but anyway there are always requests between your page and the server. And any new data has to be processed. Downloaded code is also packed with the features, most site-owners will never use.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">Not so efficient</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Due to its ubiquity, a lot of tracking-blocking systems simply are <strong class="article__col-4">not allowing Google to collect</strong> any data from the users.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3">Some ending words</h3>

			<p class="article__text">But if you can't afford yourself to buy a server or a good paid analytic tool, there are not a lot of choices:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">No tracking</strong>. This website has none, for example.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					Ask some <s>strangers</s>friends <strong class="article__col-4">to host one of the <a href="https://matomo.org/docs/installation/"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">open-sourced</a> solutions</strong>.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					You can try to keep <a href="https://plausible.io/register"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">trialling</a> some analytic tools. I'm not sure if it's going to work though.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					And <s>Yandex</s>Google Analytics.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="article__text">As you can see, sometimes you don't have much choice. There is an important note to understand: <strong class="article__col-4">it's not bad to use GA in your product - nothing is completely bad - but if you want to live in a better world, think about what matters to you and what might to your users</strong>.</p>

			<p class="article__text">There is still a lot of info I haven't covered in this article. <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-a-liability-considering-gdpr-ccpa-and-other-privacy-regulations"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">About policies</a>, for example. It's because it doesn't matter to me so much. But I left a lot of links, so you will find your way around here.</p>

		content: `
			<p class="article__text">I have personally spent a tremendous amount of time investigating this problem. Let's see why it's trickier than it seems like.</p>

			<p class="article__text">There are actually <strong class="article__col-4">three main points</strong> what could go wrong if you're facing this problem with your extensions:</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Not following the official API</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Google writes pretty decent tutorials and explanations, so I won't be copywriting it. <strong class="article__col-4"><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">This article</a> is a great showcase</strong> of what and in what cases you should be doing to make a chat between your scripts. The hints:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-sendMessage"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">How to send a message</a> (sendMessage). <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/PopUpOFF/blob/develop/content/content.js#L62"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Live example</a> in PopUpOFF content script.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#event-onMessage"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">How to handle it</a> - get and process (onMessage). <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/PopUpOFF/blob/develop/background/background.js#L90"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Example</a> from background.js.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Don't use 'chrome.extension.sendRequest || .onRequest' or 'chrome.extension.sendMessage || .onMessage'</strong> if you don't need to support the Chrome oldest versions. You most likely don't.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="article__text">You know it all well already? Still doesn't work?</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">You must've messed scripts up.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Make sure your background/content scripts are <strong class="article__col-4">updated, loaded (reloaded) and available</strong> to each other at <strong class="article__col-4">the very same moment</strong> you're trying to pass a message. Try incognito mode, disable all other extensions, go get some <s>cofee</s>water. If you're pretty sure you did everything right, but it's not working anyway - take counsel of one's pillow.</p>

			<p class="article__text"><strong class="article__col-4">It is working</strong>, but the error keeps randomly appearing? Why didn't you tell me at the start? Let's go see why:</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">Browser getting you there</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Every time you update the dev version of your extension, Chrome, or whatever browser you use, starts to use <strong class="article__col-4">the newest version of your scripts on the opened pages (if you interact with any) but content scripts are kept from the previous "version"</strong>. They are not updating automatically (you most likely set the property "run_at": "document_end", so don't blame the browser). So, technically, <strong class="article__col-4">you're trying to reach the not injected (yet!) content script from the new version - but there is no</strong> (because you didn't load the page after the extensions update), so the browser throws an error. But it can work just as well because your new script can be identical to the old one.</p>

			<p class="article__text">What to do then? Basically, you can <strong class="article__col-4">track if an old connection is not needed</strong> and disable it or manually update your scripts. I'm going to write an article about it later.</p>

			<p class="article__text">If your content script in production is updating only with the extension itself, it should not be a problem. But now you know why you're getting this error during the development and not in production.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Thank you for attention and have a great life now. See ya!</p>

			<p class="article__text">After you use "Hard" or "Easy" mode on the given website, PopUpOFF will remember it and the next time you visit any page on the site, it will be active already and prevent overlays from appearing.</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Hard mode</strong> stands for making things hard. Hard for other guys to interrupt you from reading. I'm joking. It's called "Hard" because <strong class="article__col-4">it removes every stuck to your screen element</strong>. Not any overlay, popup or whatever it's called is going to distract you from reading. <strong class="article__col-4">The best choice.</strong>
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Easy mode</strong>. However, if <strong class="article__col-4">you need sticky headers</strong> and navigation bars to be displayed - this is what you are looking for. Due to a lot of <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/PopUpOFF#remove" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">technical stuff</a>, it loads your computer more and isn't working perfectly (it will one day). So I'd suggest you use it only for decent websites.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">I JUST WANT TO READ!</strong> is for hopeless souls. If the first two ones didn't help you at all, there are overlays and popups everywhere, this guy is created to deal with it. <strong class="article__col-4">Stops to work after you leave</strong> or reload the page. Breaks the rules.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="article__text">There are also <strong class="article__col-4">stats</strong> (at the top) and <strong class="article__col-4">instructions</strong> (at the bottom) links in the popup. Just click it :)</p>

			<p class="article__text">You can disable stats at <a class="link optPage" href="#">the options page</a></p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2"><a class="link optPage" href="#">Options page.</a></h3>

			<p class="article__text">It is well-described by itself. But we're talking about efficiency, so there are three main points:</p>

			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Statistics.</strong> It takes a little bit of performance and returns a lot of <a class="link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="/secrets/">fun</a>. If you feel like 5-10% will make a difference for you, disable it.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Prevent content from hiding</strong>. I wrote <a class="link" href="/posts/prev-cont/">a tutorial<a> on this. If you don't read websites with paid content, disable it.
				</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">
					<strong class="article__col-4">Most efficiency-adding option</strong> here. "Keyboard shortcut". Scroll to the bottom. Drag (or click) to the mode you use most (left - Easy, right - Hard). Now when you open a new website with popups, just press <strong class="article__col-4">Alt + x</strong>. Closed all the overlays in 0.1 sec. Splendidly done!
				</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="article__img_wr">
	            <img
	                src="../../../assets/inline/shortcut.jpg"

			<p class="article__text">There are also <strong class="article__col-4">tutorial</strong> and <strong class="article__col-4">developer's (that's me) supervision</strong>.

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Part I</h3>

			<p class="article__text">There are <span class="article__col-1">good</span> products and <span class="article__col-2">bad</span> ones. I’ll explain by example. Imagine the situation: You are using an <span class="article__strong">ad blocker/messenger app</span>. You’re using it because the day you installed <span class="article__strong">it was most popular/everyone used it</span>. You're enjoying it and maybe even paying for it. But one day you see <span class="article__strong">ads on a popular website/news that the company listens to and reads everything you say through your messenger app</span> and you catch a glimpse: “Wow, that’s inappropriate. I have to deal with it” - And then… You just don’t. <span class="article__strong">There are no websites with ads other day/company that owns mess app publicly apologizes and assures that this will not happen again</span>. Everything is resolved "by itself" now. You forget about it till the next time something will happen. And it certainly will. Because it's an example of a <span class="article__col-2">bad</span> product. An inappropriate behaviour here is <span class="article__strong">betrayal of the idea for profit/invasion of privacy</span>. Not only are you not fighting it, but also letting it circulate. If someone asked your advice about <span class="article__strong">an ad blocker/a mess app</span>, you would name the <span class="article__col-2">bad</span> one. This way you're making <span class="article__col-2">bad</span> products spread and letting everyone know that you are good with such an attitude towards you. So they build more apps and services like this. Sorry, but you’re making the internet worse.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">Part II</h3>

			<p class="article__text">So… What can you do? Almost any product has its <span class="article__col-1">good</span> analogs. You can find it if you spend a few more minutes before installing. But your friends(if we're talking about messenger, for example) are not going to be there, aren’t they? Changing the world isn’t our goal - changing ourselves is. If one does want to chat with you, one is going to find a way to do it. You would be surprised how much you can change outside yourself once you did it inside. Explain your position to your friends. Tell them you want to use <span class="article__col-1">good</span> software and not <span class="article__col-2">bad</span> one and why. By the way, why would you want it?</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3">Part III</h3>

			<p class="article__text">As I wrote above, by not fighting inappropriate behaviour you let it continue. You make the internet deteriorate. Let the guys who treat you like that see that you are ok with it, so they continue to treat you like this. So, once they can gain profit from doing so, they won't hesitate - they already succeeded the last time. It’s a sort of a Vicious Cycle. You can’t sit, do nothing and expect that the world is going to treat you good just because it's you. Would you like to break the Vicious Cycle? What can you gain from it?</p>

			<p class="article__text">What if… You uninstall a <span class="article__col-2">bad</span> application, find its <span class="article__col-1">good</span> alternative and start to use it? Let’s see:</p>
			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">You improve the quality of your life. Obviously.</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">You let the app owner know that you’re refusing to use it anymore. No big deal, you can think, is it not?</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">You stop spreading this soft towards your surroundings. It is actually the way you can leverage any company in the world.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="article__text">If everyone had behaved themself like this, there wouldn’t have been <span class="article__col-2">bad</span> products across the world. And I'm not talking about software now. But since our topic is, there is a list of some nice(not) treatment you could have missed:</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part4">Part IV</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Below are only the facts, confirmed and apologized by companies:</p>

			<p class="article__text">There are only examples above. Naming every thing is out of this article. But you've got my idea, haven't you? I do not consider non-facts. Like when you say something and then you instantly see the ad about it in Chrome or Instagram. Google and Facebook didn't confirm it. Though, you can read <a href="https://telegra.ph/Why-Using-WhatsApp-Is-Dangerous-01-30-4" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">an article</a>, why Facebook services and apps are dangerous to use - written by Pavel Durov, creator of Telegram.</p>
			<p class="article__text">How do you recognize <span class="article__col-1">good</span> software? Typically, there are only a few common points:</p>
			<ul class="article__list article__text">
				<li class="article__list_item">Open-source.</li>
				<li class="article__list_item">Non-commercial.</li>
			</ul>
			If a product can be described as one of those, it might be a <span class="article__col-1">good</span> one. If both of above, it certainly is.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Open-source means everyone can see the code. So if there are some issues, people will find it out. People can improve it. For example, the most safe messenger app is Telegram. It is open-source and there have been no major data leaks since the day it exists, because a lot of people collaborated and improved it. On the other hand, almost any other messenger app was hacked, or leaked some amount of personal data:

			</p>


			<p class="article__text">And non-commercial means, that to gain profit from application is not the goal. So the creator is not interested in betraying his idea for money or anything else. I create non-commercial applications and PopUpOFF is a <span class="article__col-1">good</span> example. It provides unique functionality and is absolutely free. You are not going to see any ads either around any of my products or on this site.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_software_packages" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">a list</a> of all open-source software, you might find something for yourself.</p>

			<p class="article__text">It must be noted that it's possible for commercial and proprietary(closed-source) software to be the <span class="article__col-1">good</span> one but it's rather rare.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part5">Part V</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Finally, what my mission is. As a  human - I want to live in a better world. And by “want” I don’t mean “I would like you to improve it”, but to do it by myself and motivate as many people as I can, you for example.</p>

			<p class="article__text">When we talk about the internet, I’m much more powerful than the average user due to my profession. So I’m trying to apply my knowledge to make someone’s life better by <a href="/apps" class="link">my products</a>, and to make someone notice, by this article. Remember, it always matters.</p>

			<p class="article__text">If I can help you with your ideas, do not hesitate to reach me: <a href="mailto:romanisthere@pm.me" class="link">RomanistHere@pm.me</a> - I'm here, <s>captain</s>Romanist Here.</p>

			<p class="article__text">As an independent developer, I promise to deliver best-I-can-do experience to you and never give up on this idea. Thank you for your time. Have a better life now, see ya:)</p>`

			<p class="article__text">If you ever were interviewing and you recognize yourself into this post, think about the words I wrote. If you are going to, I'll show you mistakes on the example. It’s 2019. Interviewers still do their job, like they were interviewed when they started their career 10 years ago.</p>

			<p class="article__text">I’ve got a conversation with “Head of integrations” at a few-year “startup X”. Below I will show and comment full content(without regarding part) of the letter, he sent me after.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">This is how to not write your feedback letter.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">Even if it is what you really think. Keep things professional.</p>

			<p class="article__text">“We-are-not-moving-forward-stuff and here is why:</p>

			<p class="article__text">- Im expecting candidate to know what “startup X” does as a company and what is our product, meaning did a research and have a concise choice to join that company. Otherwise I have to question your motivation.” — I could say, that is totally wrong, I won’t, but it is. The company is going to get more profit from the developer, than the developer gets from the company. But he won’t decline an offer, because he is expecting to know who he is, or where he lives, etc before the interview. There are tons of jobs nowadays that developers can apply for. It’s the interviewer’s job to interest and make them motivated. It’s not working like this now, because of supply still above demand. With opposite conditions the developer would not change his line of conduct. But the interviewer would. That’s why this is wrong(okay, I said it). Let’s continue.</p>

			<p class="article__text">“- Also I consider as a good quality of a person if he knows his weak and strong sides, which means that person has reflected on that and knows where he can improve. You mentioned that you get lazy and it turns out that you actually overwork yourself. Which is fine and you will figure it out, just that we want people who have figured out life/work balance” — this is about what the truth is and what a developer has to say to get hired. Every person in this world sometimes gets lazy. You can’t beat it. It’s from evolution. But an interviewer doesn’t expect to hear the truth. He expects a “right” template-based answer. There are discussions, like “can computers replace engineers?”. I don’t know, but a script with 50 strings can replace some interviewers.</p>

			<p class="article__text">“- I absolutely believe that everyone in our industry, has things that they hate about the industry, coding etc. If a candidate tells that everything is lovely, then in get impression, that you have not got enough experience and challenges yet.” — most non-understood point for me. I don’t really know why anyone in the world would continue to do things, if there is something to hate. I know there are people of this kind. It’s just not me. Not all moments in my job are the pleasure, but if there were something to even dislike, I would choose a different profession. There are a lot of them, you know. So if a developer loves all he does, is it a bad sign?</p>

			<p class="article__text">“- We have a very tough homework and tech interview, I got impression, that you would not be able to pass that yet. I also participated yesterday in such an interview and it’s really not easy.” — that is just not professional. Nothing to comment.</p>

			<p class="article__text">“- Salary expectations were way to high for the impression I got, which also questions if you know were you stand in the industry and how good are other people. I think it would help you a lot If you could join as a junior to a very good company with experienced devs in an open space office environment.” — word “discussable” wasn’t heard. I never knew why I should join as a junior… But this one seems a little offending for me. Not professional too, though.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Don’t get me wrong. I enjoy communicating with strangers, especially from different cultures. And I’m totally fine with this one. It’s just not the way you ever treat anyone. If you’re professional — behave accordingly. And if you are in a bad mood before an interview, especially “call” one, postpone it, it’s okay.I would rather talk with you in a good mood tomorrow.</p>

			<p class="article__text">There are a lot of very nice interviewers. I was in this role many times(I’m not the “very nice” one). The goal of my narrative is to prevent you from making simple mistakes by showing them into this real example. If you haven’t found this article any useful, you’re cool. And if you have, I believe, you’re going to be cooler now.</p>

			<p class="article__text">This article is a little bit aggressive, but it’s just the way I write. “I did not not want to offend you in any way.”</p>

			<p class="article__text">Thank you for attention and let me know what you think.</p>

		content: `
			<p class="article__text">Hello. This is the story about how I tested all popular Chrome popup blockers during recording a video showcase for the extension I created myself. And what are the results.</p>

			<p class="article__text">For people, who want them fast. Results are sane enough. It is okay to use it.</p>

			<p class="article__text">And… you did not leave, fine. Conclusion is not the only matter. Let’s read, then.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part1">Prehistory</h3>

			<p class="article__text">So I am a developer. I created an extension, ironically, inspired by medium.com. Part of developers articles public here or at very similar platforms. You probably faced(or facing right now if you did not pay) a lot of bars at top/bottom or even popups interrupting you while reading.</p>

			<p class="article__text">I tried to remove them using the ad blocker feature — it can remove any element from the web page. But it would appear after reloading anyway. So I wrote a script that removes stuck to screen elements(like bars or popups with omnipresent cookies) permanently. And then I realized that someone, probably you, my dear reader, could find this kind of tool useful.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part2">History</h3>

			<p class="article__text">As you could know, to make the thing noticeable, it should be advertised. At least a little. So my plan was to expose “big” popular blockers in not doing their jobs properly. I was satisfied. But my expectations about the usefulness of these modern blockers was quite lower. The conclusion will be in the end.</p>

			<p class="article__text">I collected about 20–30 websites with annoying popups, half-screen bars with cookies or different ads. Installed about ten most popular popup blockers plus few ad ones. And started to test, recording my screen, so I can montage showcase.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Firstly, things went swimmingly. Popups kept appearing. Cookie notifications were still annoying. I had no hope panels and “buy smth” ads at top/bottom will disappear. But after a dozen of websites, I started to not see expected popups. “So it works” — thought I. And it worked. But all my extensions covered only about 30–40% of websites, other ones were still polluted.</p>

			<p class="article__text">I recorded enough to make the video I wanted. I started to montage, blah-blah. Then, based on first feedback from users, I removed part of possibilities. The less the user can, the more he is satisfied. I plan to return these opportunities, actually. But after that, I had to re record all data. I added one or two new extensions. Even paid one. And was about to repeat it the old way…</p>

			<p class="article__text">From the start I understood that something went wrong. Or, I can say, went right. First 4–5 websites from the previous road map were cleared by my pack of extensions. Not needed video content, huh? For some unknown reason blockers decided to block this time. About 70% of websites were free from popups. Not from cookie notifications and other layout, though.</p>

			<p class="article__text">I spent a few hours trying to get websites from different areas of life, where extensions were not working. Another problem I faced is that sometimes popups did appear but not for record. And when my “camera” was ready, they did not. So I can not characterize these blockers as stable.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Few more things, I had noticed, during mine little investigation:</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part3">1. Performance and user experience.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">I can not call any of my computers powerful. After I enabled all extensions(average difference in weight x100 with extension of mine, in number of scripts to execute about 100 as well), every Chrome launch took much more time, then a clean version. Part of websites loads became torture. I understand tha it is not how it is supposed to work. I mean installing all the extensions at once, but I will make my message clean. These blockers apart miss a lot. Having it all together greatly increases percent of blocked popups, but noticeably reduces the performance.</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part4">2. Wrong triggering.</h3>

			<p class="article__text">If you don't use Google for your searches, most popup blockers trigger when you just enter a different search engine. And they will not allow you to open any result. And if you force them to, they will not allow you to open the result at the new tab by clicking ctrl + mouse click, or right click and choosing “open link in new tab”. I understand how these scripts work and why. But as a user, I actually do not want them to. It is not setting up from any settings anywhere. So far, I used my “extensions starter pack” for a couple of hours, and this “feature” annoyed me much more than any popup in this life. To remove all kinds of pollution, you have to sacrifice something clean. But if it is not removing ALL problems, and still cuts your possibilities — screw it!</p>

			<h3 class="article__subtitle part5">Conclusion</h3>

			<p class="article__text">So far, it is almost all I wanted to share with you about. If you stop from reading now and think about what I want to say, you, probably, would be wrong. If you are not a fastidious guy, few or probably even one popup blocker extension in pair with any fine ad blocker would be enough, to make yourself comfortable. I believe developers updating their databases and scripts full time to make you even more comfortable.</p>

			<p class="article__text">You, probably, are not even annoyed by closing infinite popups and cookie notifications at almost every(cookie at every, it is the law), so there is nothing useful in using nor mine, nor any other tool for that. It is totally okay. I guess.</p>

			<p class="article__text">But if you are getting annoyed by closing omnipresent notifications or do not like, when something interrupts from reading, and you do like stability, you should definitely take a look at the product, I developed. This article is not about it, so I will not say anything more. You will hear about it someday anyway.</p>

			<p class="article__text">Not saying goodbye. Have a good time!</p>
